The Item Tracker project for the Corner Grocer analyzes purchase records to track item frequency, display histograms, and back up data to a file. This program helps the store better understand purchasing trends and manage inventory. Developed in C++, it follows object-oriented principles and includes input validation for robust user interaction.
While still very much an amateur I feel what I did best was debug and troubleshoot to arrive at the most efficient solution. Though time consuming it helps one learn a lot going line by line.
One thing I can still improve on is my foundational knowledge. I still consistently need to look things up and double check frequently. I would also like to get better at spotting small typos. Nothing is worse than the whole program not working because of a missed letter, bracket, or capitalization. 
Some of the challenges I faced included input validation, and linking/referencing lists. I eventually figured it out but was stuck for quite a while a few times. 
Some resources that are great are github itself, youtube, and google as silly as it sounds. 
I believe the ability to be efficient, conquer problems, learning to code itself, and data analysis can all be transferred to a myriad of place in life and career.
To maintain code I need to practice consistency following proper practices, keeping things formatted clearly, and constantly leave notes.
